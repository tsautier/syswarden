# Release v2.01.2

## FIXED
- **Ubuntu/Debian Autocompletion**: Added an automated post-installation hook in the `.deb` package (`postinst.sh`) to natively append and uncomment the `bash_completion` logic within the `root` user's `~/.bashrc`. This guarantees that the SysWarden CLI `<TAB>` autocompletion is fully functional out-of-the-box on minimal Ubuntu/Debian server environments where it is disabled by default.

---

# Release v2.01.1

## FIXED
- Resolved a `staticcheck` pipeline failure (deprecation warning) in the L7 Brute-Force module by replacing `os.SEEK_END` with the standard `io.SeekEnd` for file tailing operations, ensuring full compliance with Go 1.26 static analysis.

---

# Release v2.01.0

## ADDED
- **L7 Brute-Force & Log Analytics Engine:** SysWarden now natively replaces Fail2ban. It autonomously parses application access logs (Traefik, Nginx, Apache) in real-time (`SYSWARDEN_BRUTEFORCE_LOGS`) via an asynchronous Goroutine and detects HTTP 401/403/404 abuse. It implements a sliding-window tracker and native Nftables blocking to counter L7 bruteforce attempts.
- **Native CLI Auto-Completion:** Added full auto-completion support for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, and `powershell`. The script is automatically deployed to `/etc/bash_completion.d/syswarden` upon installation to provide immediate `<TAB>` suggestions for all SysWarden CLI commands.

---

# Release v2.00.10

## ADDED
- The `syswarden-core` WAF Engine now dynamically fetches the latest available release directly from the GitHub API (`https://api.github.com/repos/duggytuxy/syswarden/releases/latest`) and streams it to the TUI.

## FIXED
- Resolved a critical desynchronization issue where several subcomponents (like `syswarden-tui`, internal `webhooks`, and the `install.go` routines) were displaying stale, hardcoded version strings (`v2.00.0`). The automated release script (`Release-SysWarden.ps1`) has been patched to aggressively sweep and identically bump all Go files containing version strings.

---

# Release v2.00.9

## ADDED
- Implemented an **Auto-Healing WAF Bridge** recovery mechanism. The `syswarden-cli reload` command now automatically and dynamically regenerates the `rsyslog` integration bridge (`99-syswarden-waf-bridge.conf`) based on the active user configuration.

## FIXED
- Updated the CI/CD `postinst.sh` lifecycle script to execute a native `syswarden reload` instead of a simple service restart during an upgrade. This guarantees that any configuration components (like firewall rules and log bridges) destructively purged by older versions are instantaneously restored without user intervention, achieving 100% Zero-Touch Upgrades.

---

# Release v2.00.8

## FIXED
- Synchronized FPM lifecycle orchestration scripts (`postinst.sh`, `prerm.sh`, `postrm.sh`) within the official GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (`package.yml`). This ensures that natively compiled `.rpm` and `.deb` releases correctly inherit the In-Place Upgrade capabilities, preventing `syswarden-core` downtime during automated package manager upgrades.

---

# Release v2.00.7

## FIXED
- Completely restructured the internal packaging lifecycle scripts (`prerm`, `postinst`, `postrm`) within `build_packages.sh` to natively identify and manage *In-Place Upgrade* states across both `dnf/rpm` and `apt-get/dpkg` package managers. This entirely resolves a critical flaw where `syswarden-core` services and `nftables` firewall rules were being inappropriately purged or deadlocked by the package manager during an upgrade.

---

# Release v2.00.6

## FIXED
- Remediated `golangci-lint` regressions (`errcheck`) by enforcing strict and explicit error handling on all `defer` file closure operations across the Go Native engine, maintaining compliance with Zero CWE standards.

---

# Release v2.00.5

## UPDATED
- Completely rewrote the `syswarden update` orchestration engine in native Go (`pkg/system/upgrade.go`), entirely eradicating the legacy Bash script dependency (`install.sh`). The in-place upgrade mechanism now natively detects the OS architecture, securely downloads the `.rpm` or `.deb` packages via the GitHub API into memory, and natively executes `dnf install` or `apt-get install` without relying on insecure subshells.

---

# Release v2.00.3

## FIXED
- Resolved a missing cron daemon dependency during automated unattended installations on minimal RHEL 9 and Debian environments. The `.rpm` and `.deb` deployment pipelines now strictly enforce `cronie` and `cron` dependencies natively.

---

# Release v2.00.2

## ADDED
- Enterprise SIEM Forwarding: Native support for robust TCP and TLS encryption via Rsyslog's `StreamDriver` (preventing CWE-319 vulnerabilities).
- The SIEM forwarder dynamically configures TLS authentication in `anon` mode to ensure maximum compatibility with self-signed Enterprise PKIs without dropping encrypted logs.

---

# Release v2.00.1

## ADDED
- Compliance & Security SBOM artifacts generated and attached to the release payload.

## UPGRADED
- All underlying Go dependencies across `syswarden-cli`, `syswarden-core`, and `syswarden-tui` modules to mitigate OSV and CVE vulnerabilities.

## UPDATED
- Removed binary artifacts from the source repository to enforce OSSF Scorecard best practices.
- Expanded `.gitignore` controls to strictly prevent accidental binary artifact contamination.

## FIXED
- Remediated `golangci-lint` regressions, including `errcheck` and `staticcheck` issues via robust error handling and `switch` block refactoring.
- Rectified `govulncheck` execution paths within `security-audit.yml` to support multi-module workspaces.
- Corrected `gh run download` logic and pathing within `release-manager.yml` to reliably fetch release assets from parallel CI/CD jobs.
- Fixed `push` event triggers in GitHub Action workflows (`package.yml`, `security-audit.yml`, `compliance.yml`) to correctly execute on version tags.

---

- TUI and Alert dashboards dynamically separate and categorize "ALLOWED" connections in high-contrast green.
- Telemetry worker module (`worker.go`) rewritten to decouple the dependency on `syswarden-auto.conf` file mappings.
- Nftables Kernel injection engine to an O(1) atomic aggregation transaction for 350k+ GeoIP and ASN Threat Intelligence feeds.

- Modernized the 'syswarden audit' permissions evaluation to securely accept both 0600 and 0640 permissions on critical log files.
- Refactored the Global Blocklist aggregation logic to automatically track and count dynamically downloaded Data-Shield intelligence feeds in real-time.
- Dashboard Target column renamed comprehensively to `TARGET (PORT/JAIL/SERVICES)`.
- CI/CD packaging configurations (`build_packages.sh`, `package.yml`) simplified to purge the legacy copy instruction for `syswarden-auto.conf`.
- Threat feed download parser to strictly filter pure IPv4 addresses.
- Refactored the core syswarden-cli Orchestrator (cmd/install.go) to seamlessly chain the execution of all new security, firewall, network, and system modules in a strict monolithic deployment cycle.

## FIXED
- Resolved a critical TUI discrepancy where legacy OS services (rsyslog and generic nftables) were triggering false-positive 'inactive' alerts on systemd-native distributions.
- Fixed an anomaly in the WAF threat-intelligence engine that prevented successful SSH authentications from being indexed and rendered into the Alerts console.

- Corrected Whitelist array mapping in the core telemetry generator `worker.go` to properly parse `/etc/syswarden/whitelist.ipv4` natively instead of returning an empty payload, restoring `Trusted Hosts` visibility in the TUI.
- Resolved `EPROTOTYPE` (Protocol wrong type for socket) kernel transmission failures by refactoring the Native Go UDS Server (`uds.go`) to natively ingest `unixgram` datagram streams, ensuring flawless zero-copy compatibility with `rsyslog`'s `omuxsock`.
- Fixed an ISO 27001 compliance race condition where AbuseIPDB telemetry silently failed after the `syswarden-auto.conf` payload was securely wiped from disk; `syswarden-cli` now surgically extracts and locks the API Key within a dedicated `0600` `secrets.env` file.
