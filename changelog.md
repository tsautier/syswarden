# Release v3.51.6

## FIXED
- **Telemetry & Live Alerts Formatting**: Cleaned up the raw payload display in `syswarden alerts` (for both TUI and non-interactive text modes) to maintain consistent formatting. The L7 WAAP alerts (`BANNED`, `DETECTED`, `SHADOW-ALERT`) no longer append the raw log line, matching the clean structure of the network layer alerts. The native extraction of protocol/port metadata and SSH usernames remains fully functional.

---

# Release v3.51.5

## FIXED
- **HA Cluster Network Binding**: Fixed a critical parser fragility in the High Availability TLS configuration reader (`ha_api.go`) that caused silent binding failures on the listening port (e.g. `62026`). The config parser is now fully immune to trailing spaces, `\r` line endings from hybrid Windows/Linux environments, and variable quote encapsulation. Added a failsafe default to guarantee the correct port is always exposed.

---

# Release v3.51.4

## UPDATED
- **Documentation**: Updated `README.md` and `Deployment-Tutorial.md` to fully reflect the new Zero-Touch TLS P2P API architecture for High Availability clustering, removing all legacy references to SSH ports and passwordless keys.
- **HA Configuration**: Cleaned up the `syswarden config` and `syswarden manual` outputs by removing obsolete SSH parameters (e.g. `SYSWARDEN_HA_STRICT_HOST_KEY`) and explicitly indicating the use of a TLS port.

## FIXED
- **Legacy Code Cleanup**: Removed the deprecated Trust On First Use (TOFU) `ssh-keyscan` logic from the CLI's cluster setup routine (`cluster.go`), ensuring the codebase is exclusively reliant on the modern TLS API.
---

# Release v3.51.2

## FIXED
- **SSH Socket Activation Compatibility**: Fixed a critical bug in the telemetry worker (`worker.go`) where it failed to capture successful SSH logins on modern distributions utilizing socket-activated SSH (like Alma Linux 10+ and Ubuntu 24.04+). Migrated the `journalctl` query from `-u sshd` (Systemd unit matching) to `-t sshd` (Syslog Identifier matching) to ensure comprehensive session logging regardless of the underlying ephemeral `sshd@<id>.service` naming scheme.

---

# Release v3.51.1

## ADDED
- **Zero-Touch Auto-Whitelist (HA Cluster)**: The HA clustering engine now natively and autonomously whitelists all configured `SYSWARDEN_HA_PEER_IP` nodes upon installation or reload. This eliminates the need for manual firewall interventions, ensuring the native TLS P2P API seamlessly bypasses the default-deny ruleset during cluster bootstrapping.

---

# Release v3.51.0

## UPGRADED
- **High Availability (HA) Zero-Touch TLS P2P Clustering**: The HA synchronization architecture has been completely rewritten in native Go. It abandons the legacy SSH-based sync (and its requirement for manual key exchanges) in favor of a highly scalable, "Zero-Touch" TLS P2P API. `syswarden-core` now integrates a micro-server (`ha_api.go`) that dynamically generates self-signed certificates and strictly enforces Zero-Trust TCP IP validation against `SYSWARDEN_HA_PEER_IP` to instantly and securely broadcast banned IPs across 500+ node clusters without any user intervention.

---

# Release v3.50.5

## ADDED
- **GitOps Auto-Versioning CI/CD**: Migrated the legacy local PowerShell release script into a fully autonomous GitHub Actions workflow (`auto-versioning.yml`). The version bumping process (Patch, Minor, Major, Upgrade) is now dynamically orchestrated upon push to the `main` branch based on the commit message prefix, ensuring absolute consistency across all core components.

## FIXED
- **CI/CD Pipeline Syntax Error**: Fixed a critical PowerShell 7 array instantiation error within `auto-versioning.yml` that previously caused the `Join-Path` command to fail (`Cannot convert 'System.Object[]' to the type 'System.String'`) on Ubuntu runners during path generation.
---

# Release v3.50.4

## FIXED
- **OSINT Telemetry Rate-Limiting & Cache Loss**: Resolved a critical issue in `syswarden-core` where OSINT data (Country, ASN, ISP) disappeared in the TUI after executing `syswarden reload`. The in-memory telemetry cache (`osintCache`) is now securely persisted to `/var/lib/syswarden/ui/osint_cache.json` across daemon restarts. Additionally, the HTTP request execution flow to the external OSINT API has been decoupled from the primary Mutex (`osintMu`), completely preventing sequential rate-limiting (HTTP 429) and telemetry lockups (timeout) during mass ingestion of new attacking IPs.
---

# Release v3.50.3

## ADDED
- **Data-Shield Dynamic Latency Benchmark**: Engineered an autonomous, multi-threaded latency benchmarking system (`SelectFastestThreatIntelMirror`) to dynamically select the fastest Threat Intelligence mirror upon execution. The orchestration engine now pre-tests GitHub, GitLab, jsDelivr, Bitbucket, and Codeberg via HTTP `HEAD` probes, chronometers their response times, and sorts the fallback sequence strictly by optimal latency. This completely replaces the blind sequential failover, guaranteeing absolute maximum bandwidth and minimal network overhead during Zero-Trust ingestion operations.
---

# Release v3.50.2

## ADDED
- **High Availability (HA) Multi-Node Support**: The `syswarden-cli ha-sync` orchestration engine natively supports resolving and synchronizing across multiple HA peer nodes simultaneously. `SYSWARDEN_HA_PEER_IP` now accepts a space- or comma-separated list of IP addresses, effortlessly projecting the active Zero-Trust blocklist state to an entire cluster ecosystem in parallel.

## FIXED
- **AbuseIPDB Configuration Reloading**: Patched a configuration drift bug where dynamically altering `SYSWARDEN_ENTERPRISE_MODE` or `SYSWARDEN_ENABLE_ABUSE` post-installation was ignored by `syswarden reload`. The orchestrator now properly executes `SetupAbuseIPDB()` during live reloads and securely zeroes out legacy `secrets.env` configurations if the service is downgraded or deactivated.
- **Threat Intelligence Mirror Resilience**: Fixed an edge-case network exhaustion bug (`context deadline exceeded`) observed on RHEL/AlmaLinux families. The orchestration engine's global context timeout has been aggressively expanded (from 2m to 15m) to guarantee that all fallback mirrors (GitHub, GitLab, jsDelivr, Bitbucket, Codeberg) can fully execute their retry loops sequentially without being prematurely terminated by the main thread.
- **High Availability (HA) TOFU Automation**: Engineered a secure Trust On First Use (TOFU) host-key exchange sequence within the `cluster.go` orchestration engine. SysWarden now autonomously utilizes native `ssh-keyscan` during HA initialization to securely pin the standby node's ED25519 public key into the local `known_hosts` vault. This completely eliminates silent `StrictHostKeyChecking` connection drops and guarantees immediate Zero-Touch synchronization across cluster nodes without any post-installation key bridging.

---

# Release v3.50.1

## FIXED
- **Threat Intelligence Mirror Resilience**: Implemented a highly resilient mirror fallback rotation (GitHub, GitLab, jsDelivr, Bitbucket, Codeberg) within the `downloader.go` orchestration engine. This natively mitigates single-point-of-failure network timeouts (e.g., Codeberg IPv6 rate-limiting) during Data-Shield ingestion by automatically failing over to the next available enterprise CDN, ensuring uninterrupted Zero-Trust L3 protection.

---

# Release v3.50.0

## ADDED
- **Native IPv6 Support (WAF & L3/L4)**: SysWarden now natively supports full IPv6 mitigation. The Linux Nftables backend autonomously provisions the `banned_ips6` Set and corresponding drop rules, while the FreeBSD (`pf`) backend handles IPv6 blocks seamlessly, closing all potential IPv6 WAF bypass vectors.
- **Custom IPv6 Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Added native support for downloading and parsing custom IPv6 blocklists via `SYSWARDEN_CUSTOM_URL6` (when `SYSWARDEN_LIST_CHOICE=3`). The `downloader` orchestration engine now automatically syncs and injects these into `syswarden_blacklist6` ensuring custom enterprise defense coverage.
- **Zero-Trust Native IPv6 Whitelist**: Completely overhauled the `SYSWARDEN_WHITELIST_IPS` parsing engine (`auto_whitelist.go`). SysAdmins can now pass space-separated arrays containing both absolute IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The engine intelligently parses and routes them to their respective backend firewall tables without breaking the legacy configuration footprint.

## UPGRADED
- **High Availability (HA) IPv6 Sync**: Expanded the `syswarden-cli ha-sync` engine to automatically synchronize the IPv6 manual blocklist (`syswarden_blacklist.ipv6`) alongside the legacy IPv4 blocklist. The HA module utilizes purely native Go SSH automation to atomically stream cross-node IPv6 threat state without bash dependencies.
- **CLI IPv6 Enforcement**: Upgraded the `syswarden block`, `syswarden unblock`, `syswarden check`, and `syswarden list` commands to natively accept, parse, and enforce full IPv6 arrays, injecting them dynamically into the kernel L3 firewall.
- **UDS Socket Hardening (LPE Prevention)**: Strictly hardened the UNIX Domain Socket permissions for `/var/run/syswarden.sock` from `0666` to `0660`. This aggressively isolates the daemon communication bridge, preventing any non-privileged user from interacting with the socket and nullifying Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) risks.
- **Code Hygiene**: Enforced strict `gofmt` formatting and standard library `net` imports across the Core engine to guarantee 100% CI/CD pipeline compliance and robust cross-platform compilation.

## FIXED
- **IPv6 Regex Precision (Aho-Corasick)**: Completely rewrote the `ExtractIP` regular expression engine to surgically capture abbreviated IPv6 formats (e.g., `fe80::1`) while strictly preventing greedy matches against standard log timestamps (e.g., `12:00:00`), ensuring Zero False Positives during IPv6 threat qualification.
- **FreeBSD Threat Intelligence Persistence (PF)**: Resolved a critical regression where the FreeBSD Packet Filter (`pf`) backend silently failed to load massive threat intelligence sets (Global Blocklist, GeoIP, ASN). SysWarden now orchestrates the `persist file` directive to force native filesystem loading for all PF tables, securely mapping up to 400,000 dual-stack CIDRs into kernel memory without overflowing the CLI execution buffer.
- **Dual-Stack ASN WHOIS Routing**: Corrected the `syswarden update-feeds` engine to natively intercept both `route:` and `route6:` objects when querying RADB (`whois.radb.net`). The ASN threat vectors are now flawlessly segmented into `.ipv4` and `.ipv6` lists and injected directly into `syswarden_asn` and `syswarden_asn6` kernel sets, guaranteeing absolute IPv6 infrastructure defense.

---

# Release v3.41.0

## UPDATED
- **Signatures Mapping / CMS Honeypot**: Renamed the generic `cms-honeypot` L7 WAAP rule to a highly specific `cms-wordpress` identifier. Realigned the Aho-Corasick payload array (`/wp-includes`, `/wp-admin`, `/wp-login.php`, `xmlrpc.php`, `wp-config.php`) to strictly target WordPress vectors, drastically improving SIEM visibility and eliminating heuristic overlaps.

## FIXED
- **L7 WAAP Signature Shadowing**: Restructured the hierarchical evaluation order within `signatures.json` to enforce a "Most Specific First" paradigm. Moved aggressive catch-all regexes (`nginx-scanner`, `laravel-login`, `generic-auth`) to the absolute bottom of the evaluation stack. This completely eliminates rule shadowing and guarantees that highly specific CVEs and service alerts (e.g., `nginx-tls`) trigger correctly before being swallowed by generic L7 patterns.
- **SQLi-XSS Payload Refactoring**: Split the monolithic `sqli-xss` Aho-Corasick rule to exclusively target SQL injection patterns (`UNION SELECT`, `CONCAT(`, `WAITFOR DELAY`, `SLEEP(`). Stripped redundant XSS and LFI vectors (`<script`, `alert(`, `../../`) that were already covered by the dedicated Zero-Overhead `owasp-a03-xss` and `l7-lfi` rules, ensuring absolute precision and Zero False Positives during heuristic analysis.
- **Regex Extraction Precision**: Fixed critical regex spacing and string boundary matching anomalies within the `haproxy-abuse`, `slowloris`, and `redis-auth` L7 rules. Ensures that WAF detection executes flawlessly across a 74/74 multi-vector signature battery test.

---

# Release v3.40.8

## FIXED
- **Engine / Regex False Positives**: Fixed a highly specific false-positive in the `ahocorasick` matching engine where the generic `<HOST>` replacement regex for IPv6 (`[a-fA-F0-9:]+`) was overly greedy and could mistakenly match log timestamps (e.g., `12:50:59`) and random port combinations, triggering incorrect L7 WAAP jails (like `haproxy-abuse`) for standard SSH blocks. The `<HOST>` placeholder now uses a strict, boundary-enforced regex to exclusively match valid IPv4 and IPv6 structures, ensuring flawless threat qualification.

---

# Release v3.40.7

## FIXED
- **Telemetry Formatting & Syslog Recursion Loop**: Resolved a critical defect where SysWarden logging its own block events into Syslog caused an infinite recursive feedback loop through the Rsyslog `waf_bridge`, inflating the `payload` field uncontrollably in the UI. Implemented a strict drop-rule for `syswarden-core` messages at the bridge layer and introduced a native `SysWardenRaw` template to strip Syslog framing (`<PRI>`, timestamp, hostname) before routing to the UDS socket. As a result, SIEM, Wazuh, and local TUI logs are now perfectly formatted with exact raw string payloads for both Web and SSH components.

---

# Release v3.40.6

## FIXED
- **HIDS / SSH Brute-Force Visibility**: Fixed a critical log forwarding omission where `syswarden-cli` only configured Rsyslog to forward Web server logs (Nginx/Apache) to the core engine socket (`waf_bridge`). The configuration (`waf_logs_linux.go` and `waf_logs_freebsd.go`) has been updated to nativey include `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/secure`, `/var/log/syslog`, and `/var/log/messages`, instantly restoring SysWarden's capability to detect and ban SSH brute-force attempts.

---

# Release v3.40.5

## ADDED
- **Advanced Threat Intel WAAP Signatures (L7)**: Integrated new zero-day/CVE signatures (JetBrains TeamCity, Citrix Bleed, MOVEit, F5 BIG-IP) with immediate BAN enforcement. Added advanced generic payloads targeting Cloud SSRF (AWS/Azure/GCP Metadata), Java SSTI/RCE (freemarker, getRuntime), and malicious AI crawlers in DETECT mode for precise triage and low false-positive rates.
- **Deep Packet Inspection & Network Threat Intel (L3/L4)**: Drastically hardened native firewalls (Nftables for Linux/Alpine, PF for FreeBSD) by introducing kernel-level mitigation against NULL and XMAS port scans, dropping invalid IP fragments (Nmap evasion), and implementing strict UDP payload limits (dropping UDP/53 > 512 bytes) to proactively neutralize DNS exfiltration attempts.
---

# Release v3.40.4

## ADDED
- **Spamhaus ASN-DROP Support**: Implemented dynamic downloading and parsing of the `asndrop.json` (JSON Lines) list. Integrated deduplication against custom ASN lists, enforcing native ASN extraction and blocking while strictly rate-limiting RADB WHOIS lookups to prevent blacklisting. The implementation safely ignores IPv6 constraints at the WHOIS parsing layer to maintain compatibility with Nftables chunking logic.

---

# Release v3.40.3

## FIXED
- **Alpine Linux Support (In-Place Upgrade)**: Fixed a critical issue where running `syswarden update` on Alpine Linux 3.23+ would fail with a missing package manager error. The `upgrade.go` engine has been updated to nativey detect and use `apk` to securely download and install `.apk` updates via `apk add --allow-untrusted`.

---

# Release v3.40.2

### FIXED

Error package and code hygiene v3.40.1

---

# Release v3.40.1

## FIXED
- **Code Hygiene (golangci-lint)**: Addressed a `staticcheck` error (`QF1003: could use tagged switch on b.Action`) in the TUI (`syswarden-tui/main.go`). The `if-else if` block for parsing telemetry actions has been optimized into a clean `switch` statement to satisfy strict continuous integration compliance and eliminate pipeline failures.

---

# Release v3.40.0

## ADDED
- **Insider Threat Detection (DETECTED Mode)**: Implemented the `DETECTED` action mode for WAAP signatures. Rules tagged with `"action": "detect"` are logged natively as `DETECTED` severity without executing an L7 ban, ensuring zero-regression observability.
- **SIEM Telemetry Parsing**: Enhanced the WAF/Telemetry JSON parser and `syswarden-core/logger` to dynamically append `Severity` mapping: `BANNED=10`, `SHADOW-ALERT=8`, `DETECTED=7`, `ALLOWED=3`. This natively guarantees accurate severity routing across SIEM integrations (Wazuh, Splunk).

## UPDATED
- **TUI & Live Alerts Real-Time Display**: Overhauled `syswarden alerts` and `syswarden tui` (Dashboards) to distinctly colorize and trace `DETECTED` heuristics (Yellow) in real-time, matching SOC visibility standards.
- **Webhook Dispatcher (Discord/Slack)**: Updated the webhook integration core to uniquely style and map `DETECTED` alert vectors with a dedicated Orange/Yellow visual indicator to distinguish from active blocking.

## FIXED
- **WireGuard Persistence (#43)**: Remedied a devastating oversight where installing `syswarden v3.31.1` abruptly terminated the active WireGuard `wg0` tunnel. SysWarden now rigorously preserves pre-existing encrypted tunnels during setup.

---


# Release v3.31.1

## FIXED
- **OSINT Enrichment (Datacenter IP Ban)**: Switched the telemetry OSINT provider from `FreeIPAPI` to `ip-api.com`. `FreeIPAPI` was found to natively block HTTP requests originating from Cloud/Datacenter ASNs (like OVH) with a `403 Forbidden` error, resulting in empty data in the TUI. `ip-api.com` natively handles 45 req/min (64,800/day) and cleanly resolves IP geolocation and ASN data regardless of the hosting provider.

---

# Release v3.31.0

## ADDED
- **ARM64 Support**: Native cross-compilation support for `linux/arm64` (aarch64) in CI/CD. Distribution packages (`.deb`, `.rpm`, `.apk`) and raw binaries are now seamlessly built, bundled, and released automatically to support ARM architectures (e.g., AWS Graviton, Raspberry Pi, Oracle Cloud).

## UPDATED
- **OSINT Threat Intelligence Engine**: Migrated the core IP metadata enrichment provider to `FreeIPAPI` over HTTPS (`de.freeipapi.com`). This enterprise-level transition natively supports extremely high-volume environments (60 requests/minute or ~86,000/day) without requiring API keys, eliminating previous restrictions while maintaining absolute 100% precision on Country, ASN, and ISP data in the TUI Dashboard.

---

# Release v3.30.0

## ADDED
- **Alpine Linux Support**: Full native support for Alpine Linux (3.21+). The Go WAF and CLI orchestrator automatically detect Alpine at runtime and natively configure `apk` dependencies, `rc-update/rc-service` (OpenRC) system services, and route WAF/kernel logging via `/var/log/messages` (`tail -F`) instead of `journalctl`, providing a seamless and highly optimized security deployment on lightweight alpine architectures.

---

# Release v3.20.2

## FIXED
- **OSINT Enrichment**: Fixed an inconsistency in the `syswarden tui` dashboard where the "Top Attackers" table displayed a hardcoded port (`80/443`) regardless of the actual attack vector. The `enrichOSINT` telemetry engine now dynamically extracts the exact targeted port (`DPT`) directly from the firewall drop payload using robust regular expressions, ensuring perfect alignment with the "Trigger Payload" data.

---

# Release v3.20.1

## FIXED
- **Code Hygiene (golangci-lint)**: Addressed multiple CI pipeline errors flagged by `govet` and `staticcheck`. Fixed missing `%s` formatting directives in `manual.go` ANSI color output blocks.
- **Code Hygiene (golangci-lint)**: Refactored redundant `if-else` action chains into optimized `switch` statements across `alerts.go` and `worker.go` to satisfy `QF1003` staticcheck constraints.
- **Code Hygiene (golangci-lint)**: Eliminated explicit slice type declarations (`var finalData []byte = data`) in `discord.go` in favor of idiomatic type inference (`finalData := data`), resolving `ST1023` linting warnings and ensuring a flawless CI/CD green build.

---

# Release v3.20.0

## ADDED
- **Insider Threat Detection (Shadow Mode)**: Implemented a robust 'Shadow Mode' framework designed specifically for zero-trust environments. When malicious L7/WAF behaviors (e.g., PrivEsc, RCE attempts, unauthorized enumeration) originate from whitelisted administrative IPs, SysWarden now silently tags the event as a `SHADOW-ALERT` instead of enforcing a ban. This prevents service disruption for legitimate admins while ensuring immediate SOC visibility into compromised credentials.
- **Honeyports (L3 Lures)**: Introduced `SYSWARDEN_HONEYPORTS`, allowing SysAdmins to seamlessly expose fake open ports natively protected by Nftables and PF. Any internal connection attempts to these decoys immediately trigger silent SOC alerts if originating from a whitelisted IP, or result in an instant ban for unauthorized IPs.
- **Unified Multi-Webhook Dispatcher**: Rewrote the webhook telemetry engine to natively support Slack, alongside Discord and MS Teams. Security Operations Centers now receive rich, color-coded, real-time threat intelligence feeds directly to their platform of choice, including explicit differentiation for `SHADOW-ALERT` events.
- **SysWarden Dashboard (TUI) Enhancements**: Expanded the terminal user interface (`syswarden tui`) and live telemetry stream (`syswarden alerts`) to natively parse and distinctly colorize `SHADOW-ALERT` and `ALLOWED` events, improving visibility for SOC analysts.

## UPDATED
- **Wazuh HIDS Integration**: Upgraded the automated Wazuh agent integration engine. SysWarden now natively injects explicit `<localfile>` blocks into `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` to guarantee `waf.json` telemetry and `core.log` tracing are immediately ingested by Wazuh, maintaining 100% SIEM compliance.
- **FreeBSD Compatibility**: Ensured full compatibility for FreeBSD 14.4+ architectures, translating native Honeyport traps into compliant Packet Filter (`pf`) drop rules, guaranteeing identical enterprise-grade protection across Linux and BSD deployments.

---

# Release v3.10.3

## ADDED
- **L7 WAAP Programmatic Immunity:** Developed a native, high-performance, in-memory cache module (`utils.IsWhitelisted()`) that dynamically parses and caches infrastructure IPs (`syswarden_whitelist.ipv4`, `syswarden_whitelist.ipv6`) and local loopbacks (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`). This explicitly grants absolute L7 WAAP and L3 Catch-All immunity to administrative IPs, drastically reducing CPU overhead and disk I/O bottlenecks without relying on external packages.

## FIXED
- **WordPress Administrator Self-Lockouts:** Resolved a critical bug where the asynchronous L7 WAAP daemon (`waap.go`) blindly banned authenticated administrators and legitimate local server cron jobs (e.g., `wp-cron.php` HTTP POST requests) that tripped rate-limits or payload heuristics. The WAAP engine now natively validates all requests against the programmatic immunity cache before enforcing drops or logging.

## UPDATED
- **Zero-Trust Architectural Separation:** Completely refactored the kernel firewall architectures (`firewall_linux.go` and `firewall_freebsd.go`) to physically decouple the **Infra Whitelist** (`syswarden_whitelist`) from the **Zero-Trust Allowed** countries/ASNs (`syswarden_zt_allowed`). This seals a critical logic flaw where Zero-Trust permitted countries inadvertently bypassed ThreatIntel blocklists. Infra IPs are now processed with ultimate `pass in quick` priority, while Zero-Trust ranges remain strictly subjected to all WAF and Intelligence evaluation phases.

---

# Release v3.10.2

## FIXED
- **Universal Nftables Compatibility (LXC/Proxmox):** Refactored the core atomic firewall transaction in `syswarden-cli`. The modern `destroy table` syntax, which triggers `unexpected table` syntax errors on older or strict LXC environments (e.g., Debian 11/12 on Proxmox VE), has been replaced with pre-transaction silent `nft delete table` commands. This guarantees 100% backward and forward compatibility without sacrificing atomic load safety.

---

# Release v3.10.1

## UPDATED
- **TUI & Alerts Formatting:** Enhanced `syswarden alerts` to intelligently parse raw kernel payload strings for `L3-PORTSCAN` and `L2-ARP-FLOOD` blocks. Instead of displaying the raw `dmesg` buffer, the alerts now cleanly extract and display just the relevant `PORT` or `PROTO` (e.g., `JAIL: L3-PORTSCAN | PORT: 8080`), vastly improving terminal readability.

---

# Release v3.10.0

## FIXED
- **CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption):** Applied a strict kernel-level rate limit (`limit rate 2/second burst 5 packets`) to the `[Catch-All]` firewall logging rule in Linux (nftables/iptables) to completely eliminate CPU exhaustion loops during aggressive volumetric port scans (e.g. Nmap, OpenVAS).
- **L3 Portscan Auto-Ban (Fail2ban Parity):** Engineered a high-performance in-memory telemetry state tracker native to Go. SysWarden now parses dropped packet logs efficiently and executes a definitive L3 native silent drop ban after 3 occurrences, instantly terminating the attacker's portscan without external dependencies.

---

# Release v3.01.0

## ADDED
- **Native FreeBSD CIS Hardening:** Successfully ported the CIS Level 2 Kernel and OS-level hardening directly to FreeBSD 14+. The new architecture implements rigorous protection equivalent to Linux configurations via native sysctl overrides (`security.bsd.*` and `net.inet.tcp.blackhole=2`), without interfering with the PF engine.
- **Zero-Trust FreeBSD Profiles:** Hardened standard FreeBSD profiles (`.cshrc`, `.profile`) with the `schg` immutable file flag, matching Linux `chattr` standards.
- **FreeBSD Core Dump Restrictions:** Implemented strict memory limits (`kern.coredump=0`, `kern.sugid_coredump=0`) via `sysctl.conf` to block memory exploitation.

---

# Release v3.00.1

## FIXED
- **CI/CD Pipeline (FreeBSD Artifacts):** Resolved a failure in `package.yml` and `release-manager.yml` where `sha256sum` and GitHub Artifact uploads expected `.pkg` files, whereas FPM accurately generates `.txz` archives for FreeBSD. All pipeline references have been safely updated to `.txz`.
- **Go Cache Dependency Resolution:** Fixed a caching crash during the `actions/setup-go` workflow step by explicitly mapping `cache-dependency-path` to `go.work.sum`, since SysWarden utilizes a root-level workspace architecture.

---

# Release v3.00.0

## ADDED
- FreeBSD 14+ Native Support via abstraction layer (`//go:build freebsd`).
- Full PF (Packet Filter) support for L3/L4 and L7 WAAP integration.
- Native Kernel Layer 2 ARP Spoofing Protection for FreeBSD via `sysctl` hardening (`log_arp_movements`).
- Native `rc.d` FreeBSD service orchestration integration.
- Abstracted WireGuard VPN integration using PF NAT anchor (`syswarden_wg`) and `sysrc` for FreeBSD.
- Abstracted SIEM (Wazuh/Rsyslog) bridge telemetry integration for FreeBSD paths and daemons (`/usr/local/etc/rsyslog.d`).
- Abstracted Real-Time Telemetry (Core & CLI) from Linux `journalctl` to native FreeBSD `syslog` (`/var/log/messages`).
- Package generation for `.pkg` explicitly utilizing FPM inside the GitHub CI/CD Actions pipeline.

## UPGRADED
- Refactored `pkg/system`, `pkg/network` and `pkg/integration` to securely support FreeBSD without breaking the Linux ecosystem.
- Cross-platform dependency check mechanisms adapted for `pkg` versus `apt`/`dnf`.
- Web Showcase and Wiki fully updated to reflect multi-OS integration (Linux & FreeBSD Jails/bhyve capabilities).

## FIXED
- **OSSF Scorecard (Supply Chain Security):** Addressed the High-Severity `Binary-Artifacts #91` alert by aggressively purging the local compiled test binary (`syswarden_test`) from the repository's git index and enforcing strict `.gitignore` boundaries for all Go test artifacts. This guarantees absolute compliance with SLSA and OSSF source-review guidelines.

---

# Release v2.40.0

## ADDED
- [WAAP L7] Proactive Heuristics: Integrated three new zero-overhead detection jails natively into `waap.go` (`l7-ssrf`, `l7-nosql`, `l7-api`), successfully blocking Cloud metadata exfiltration, MongoDB/CouchDB injections, and generic API/GraphQL schema enumeration without impacting performance.
- [Telemetry] SIEM & AbuseIPDB Mapping: Dynamically integrated the new WAAP L7 jails into the `telemetry/abuse.go` AbuseIPDB reporter, natively mapping them to the Web App Attack (Category 21) logic.
- [Threat Intelligence] Modern CVEs & Scanners: Expanded `signatures.json` with highly critical Aho-Corasick patterns targeting Java/PHP Deserialization (`ysoserial`), Ivanti/Confluence CVE paths, and aggressively dropping advanced fuzzers (`ffuf`, `kiterunner`) and novel AI crawlers (PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot).

## REMOVED
- [Layer 2] MAC Address Filtering: Removed `SYSWARDEN_MAC_BLACKLIST` and associated filtering logic. MAC blocking is easily circumvented via spoofing and offers no real Zero-Trust boundary. Hardware Layer 2 ARP Spoofing prevention (`SYSWARDEN_ARP_PROTECT`) remains active and strictly enforced.

## UPDATED
- [WAAP L7] Legacy Substring Engine: Fortified existing SQLi, XSS, LFI, and RCE zero-overhead arrays with advanced bypass vectors (`pg_sleep`, `php://filter`, `${lower:jndi}`).

---

# Release v2.30.2

## ADDED
- [SecOps] SysWarden Enterprise Manual: Introduced the exhaustive `syswarden manual` command. This interactive module provides comprehensive documentation on all CLI commands, `syswarden-auto.conf` configuration parameters (including Zero-Trust L3 and WAAP L7 variables), and the complete structure of the Data-Shield Threat Intelligence postures (`standard`, `critical`).

---

# Release v2.30.1

## UPDATED
- [SecOps] SysWarden Audit Engine: The `syswarden audit` CLI command has been completely overhauled to natively recognize and validate the new Zero-Trust Strict ALLOW architecture (GeoIP and ASN). It now also actively audits the WAAP L7 Engine status, confirming Auto-Discovery mechanisms and L7 Independence capabilities.

---

# Release v2.30.0

## ADDED
- [Governance] Zero-Trust Strict ALLOW Mode for GeoIP and ASN. Introduces `SYSWARDEN_GEO_ALLOWED` and `SYSWARDEN_ASN_ALLOWED`. If configured, the engine operates in a default-deny state, blocking all inbound traffic except for the explicitly whitelisted countries or ASNs, natively merging with the hardware `syswarden_whitelist` set for O(1) processing.
- [SecOps] WAAP L7 Independence: Even if an IP is allowed via the new Zero-Trust L3 whitelist, the WAAP engine retains absolute priority. If a whitelisted IP initiates a malicious attack (SQLi, XSS, etc.), it is immediately banned, dropped, and reported to the SIEM.
---

# Release v2.20.1

## ADDED
- WAAP Auto-Discovery (Zero-Config Absolu): The WAAP engine now natively probes the file system for standard web server log directories (`/var/log/nginx`, `/var/log/apache2`, `/var/log/httpd`, `/var/log/caddy`, `/var/log/traefik`, `/var/log/lighttpd`). By setting `SYSWARDEN_BRUTEFORCE_LOGS="auto"` (the new default), SysWarden intelligently tails active web server access logs. This guarantees instant, zero-configuration L7 protection for amateur sysadmins without losing manual override capabilities for advanced users.

---

# Release v2.20.0

## ADDED
- Advanced WAAP (L7) Engine: The L7 engine (`waap.go`) now performs Zero-Overhead Substring Matching for critical payload signatures, expanding defense beyond brute-force. It now natively detects and immediately bans attacks targeting SQL Injection (`l7-sqli`), Cross-Site Scripting (`l7-xss`), Local File Inclusion (`l7-lfi`), Remote Code Execution (`l7-rce`), and Malicious Scanners (`l7-scanner`), all without complex RegEx CPU overhead.
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: Dynamically integrated specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques in the telemetry engine to natively reflect heuristic WAF bans in the TUI (e.g., T1190 for Exploits, T1595 for Active Scanning, T1110 for Brute Force).
- AbuseIPDB Integration: Added dynamic mappings for the new WAAP jails (`l7-sqli`, `l7-rce`, etc.) to specific AbuseIPDB categories (16, 19, 21) for highly accurate Threat Intelligence reporting.
- Native JSON SIEM Integration: Rsyslog integration now explicitly leverages the `imfile` module to forward the raw WAAP telemetry (`/var/log/syswarden/waf.json`) in pure JSON format to enterprise SIEMs (Elastic, Splunk, Wazuh) without requiring complex grok decoding.

## FIXED
- TTY Fallback (Non-Interactive CLI): Implemented an intelligent fallback mechanism (`term.IsTerminal`) across `syswarden alerts` and `syswarden tui`. The interface now perfectly degrades into a clean, parseable text stream instead of panicking when executed without a pseudo-terminal (e.g., Cron, SSH without `-t`, or CI/CD pipelines).
- Webhook Asymmetry: Resolved an issue where only Kernel-level (L3) drops triggered Discord/Teams notifications. The notification payload generation is now strictly coupled with the `logger.go` core, ensuring all WAAP (L7) mitigation events are immediately broadcasted to the SOC.

---

# Release v2.10.1

## ADDED
- ARP Spoofing Telemetry Integration: Natively integrated OSI Layer 2 ARP flood alerts directly into the Enterprise Dashboard (`syswarden tui`) and live alerts feed (`syswarden alerts`). The `syswarden-core` daemon now asynchronously monitors the kernel ring buffer for `[SysWarden-ARP-FLOOD]` events via `journalctl -k` and injects hardware-level attack traces seamlessly into the WAF telemetry pipeline.

---

# Release v2.10.0

## ADDED
- Layer 2 Protection Engine: Implemented native OSI Layer 2 filtering capabilities leveraging NFTables netdev and arp families.
- MAC Blacklist Capability: Introduced strict MAC address blocking at the ingress hook, ensuring zero interference with L3 routing, Docker networks, or existing firewalls (UFW/Firewalld).
- ARP Flooding Protection: Integrated aggressive ARP request rate-limiting (max 10 req/s) to neutralize ARP Spoofing/Flooding attacks while maintaining full compatibility with High Availability architectures (VRRP/Keepalived).
- Configuration Variables: Added SYSWARDEN_ENABLE_L2, SYSWARDEN_MAC_BLACKLIST, SYSWARDEN_ARP_PROTECT, and SYSWARDEN_LAN_MODE to the global configuration parser.
- Local LAN Mode (Air-Gapped/Zero-Trust): Implemented SYSWARDEN_LAN_MODE. When enabled, SysWarden intelligently bypasses the download and memory injection of massive public OSINT blocklists (Data-Shield, GeoIP, ASN) to heavily optimize RAM/CPU/Bandwidth on strictly internal servers, while maintaining full internal L2/L7 defenses.

## UPGRADED
- Configuration Security: Implemented rigorous IEEE 802 Regex validation for all MAC address inputs to definitively prevent NFTables syntax poisoning and runtime crashes.

## UPDATED
- Nftables Generator: Restructured the atomic deployment engine to cleanly provision, append, and destroy the netdev and arp families upon reload.

## FIXED
- None

# Release v2.01.11

## FIXED
- **Missing Cron Jobs Persistent Warning**: Fixed an issue where nodes upgraded from a previously bugged version (v2.01.8) would continuously report missing background tasks during `syswarden audit`. The `syswarden reload` command, executed automatically during package upgrades, now proactively inspects and safely repairs any missing `update-feeds` and `ha-sync` cron orchestration routines.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Failure (`syswarden-cli`)**: Resolved a fatal compilation error (`undefined: strings`) in `pkg/system/uninstall.go` caused by a missing library import during the native Go cron refactoring. The build pipeline and GitHub Actions now successfully compile the executable and generate the `.deb` and `.rpm` deployment artifacts.

---

# Release v2.01.9

## FIXED
- **Cron Orchestration Idempotency Bug**: Resolved a critical logic flaw in `downloader.go` and `cluster.go` where updating SysWarden on minimalist/hardened Debian systems would permanently delete the background Threat Intelligence and HA synchronization cron jobs. The update routine now uses 100% native Go string parsing to guarantee clean, atomic modifications to the `crontab` without relying on fragile bash pipelines (`grep -v`), fully resolving the `No automated SysWarden background jobs found` warning during `syswarden audit`.

---

# Release v2.01.8

## FIXED
- **Code Hygiene (CI/CD Pipeline)**: Cleaned up phantom `"os"` package imports across multiple CLI commands (`whitelist.go`, `unwhitelist.go`, `block.go`, `unblock.go`). This resolves a strict compilation and `golangci-lint` failure encountered by GitHub Actions runners during the automated build process.

---

# Release v2.01.6

## FIXED
- **Config Parser Oversight**: Resolved a core engine issue where the `SYSWARDEN_WHITELIST_IPS` configuration parameter was successfully parsed from `syswarden-auto.conf` but skipped during the firewall compilation phase. Custom whitelists are now flawlessly injected into the Nftables `syswarden_whitelist` set upon startup and reload.

## ADDED
- **Unlimited CLI Arguments**: The SysWarden CLI `whitelist`, `block`, `unwhitelist`, and `unblock` commands now natively support an unlimited number of arguments simultaneously (`syswarden block IP1 IP2 IP3...`). The strict parameter limits (e.g., `cobra.RangeArgs(1, 2)`) have been lifted, enabling instantaneous mass-processing.

---

# Release v2.01.4
- **APT Sandbox Warning (CIS2/ANSSI)**: Resolved an issue where `syswarden update` triggered an APT Notice (`_apt` user permission denied) during `.deb` upgrades on highly hardened Debian/Ubuntu servers enforcing `fs.protected_regular=2`. The update engine now natively changes the ownership of the downloaded package to the `_apt` user before installation, guaranteeing flawless and completely silent APT Sandbox compliance.

---

# Release v2.01.3

## ADDED
- **Native CIDR (Subnet) Support**: The SysWarden CLI `whitelist` and `block` commands now natively accept full CIDR notations (e.g., `10.0.0.0/24`, `192.168.0.0/16`). These subnets are dynamically parsed and injected into Nftables interval sets (`flags interval; auto-merge;`), enabling O(1) matching for massive IP ranges without any performance degradation.

---

# Release v2.01.2

## FIXED
- **Ubuntu/Debian Autocompletion**: Added an automated post-installation hook in the `.deb` package (`postinst.sh`) to natively append and uncomment the `bash_completion` logic within the `root` user's `~/.bashrc`. This guarantees that the SysWarden CLI `<TAB>` autocompletion is fully functional out-of-the-box on minimal Ubuntu/Debian server environments where it is disabled by default.

---

# Release v2.01.1

## FIXED
- Resolved a `staticcheck` pipeline failure (deprecation warning) in the L7 Brute-Force module by replacing `os.SEEK_END` with the standard `io.SeekEnd` for file tailing operations, ensuring full compliance with Go 1.26 static analysis.

---

# Release v2.01.0

## ADDED
- **L7 Brute-Force & Log Analytics Engine:** SysWarden now natively replaces Fail2ban. It autonomously parses application access logs (Traefik, Nginx, Apache) in real-time (`SYSWARDEN_BRUTEFORCE_LOGS`) via an asynchronous Goroutine and detects HTTP 401/403/404 abuse. It implements a sliding-window tracker and native Nftables blocking to counter L7 bruteforce attempts.
- **Native CLI Auto-Completion:** Added full auto-completion support for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, and `powershell`. The script is automatically deployed to `/etc/bash_completion.d/syswarden` upon installation to provide immediate `<TAB>` suggestions for all SysWarden CLI commands.

---

# Release v2.00.10

## ADDED
- The `syswarden-core` WAF Engine now dynamically fetches the latest available release directly from the GitHub API (`https://api.github.com/repos/duggytuxy/syswarden/releases/latest`) and streams it to the TUI.

## FIXED
- Resolved a critical desynchronization issue where several subcomponents (like `syswarden-tui`, internal `webhooks`, and the `install.go` routines) were displaying stale, hardcoded version strings (`v2.00.0`). The automated release script (`Release-SysWarden.ps1`) has been patched to aggressively sweep and identically bump all Go files containing version strings.

---

# Release v2.00.9

## ADDED
- Implemented an **Auto-Healing WAF Bridge** recovery mechanism. The `syswarden-cli reload` command now automatically and dynamically regenerates the `rsyslog` integration bridge (`99-syswarden-waf-bridge.conf`) based on the active user configuration.

## FIXED
- Updated the CI/CD `postinst.sh` lifecycle script to execute a native `syswarden reload` instead of a simple service restart during an upgrade. This guarantees that any configuration components (like firewall rules and log bridges) destructively purged by older versions are instantaneously restored without user intervention, achieving 100% Zero-Touch Upgrades.

---

# Release v2.00.8

## FIXED
- Synchronized FPM lifecycle orchestration scripts (`postinst.sh`, `prerm.sh`, `postrm.sh`) within the official GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (`package.yml`). This ensures that natively compiled `.rpm` and `.deb` releases correctly inherit the In-Place Upgrade capabilities, preventing `syswarden-core` downtime during automated package manager upgrades.

---

# Release v2.00.7

## FIXED
- Completely restructured the internal packaging lifecycle scripts (`prerm`, `postinst`, `postrm`) within `build_packages.sh` to natively identify and manage *In-Place Upgrade* states across both `dnf/rpm` and `apt-get/dpkg` package managers. This entirely resolves a critical flaw where `syswarden-core` services and `nftables` firewall rules were being inappropriately purged or deadlocked by the package manager during an upgrade.

---

# Release v2.00.6

## FIXED
- Remediated `golangci-lint` regressions (`errcheck`) by enforcing strict and explicit error handling on all `defer` file closure operations across the Go Native engine, maintaining compliance with Zero CWE standards.

---

# Release v2.00.5

## UPDATED
- Completely rewrote the `syswarden update` orchestration engine in native Go (`pkg/system/upgrade.go`), entirely eradicating the legacy Bash script dependency (`install.sh`). The in-place upgrade mechanism now natively detects the OS architecture, securely downloads the `.rpm` or `.deb` packages via the GitHub API into memory, and natively executes `dnf install` or `apt-get install` without relying on insecure subshells.

---

# Release v2.00.3

## FIXED
- Resolved a missing cron daemon dependency during automated unattended installations on minimal RHEL 9 and Debian environments. The `.rpm` and `.deb` deployment pipelines now strictly enforce `cronie` and `cron` dependencies natively.

---

# Release v2.00.2

## ADDED
- Enterprise SIEM Forwarding: Native support for robust TCP and TLS encryption via Rsyslog's `StreamDriver` (preventing CWE-319 vulnerabilities).
- The SIEM forwarder dynamically configures TLS authentication in `anon` mode to ensure maximum compatibility with self-signed Enterprise PKIs without dropping encrypted logs.

---

# Release v2.00.1

## ADDED
- Compliance & Security SBOM artifacts generated and attached to the release payload.

## UPGRADED
- All underlying Go dependencies across `syswarden-cli`, `syswarden-core`, and `syswarden-tui` modules to mitigate OSV and CVE vulnerabilities.

## UPDATED
- Removed binary artifacts from the source repository to enforce OSSF Scorecard best practices.
- Expanded `.gitignore` controls to strictly prevent accidental binary artifact contamination.

## FIXED
- Remediated `golangci-lint` regressions, including `errcheck` and `staticcheck` issues via robust error handling and `switch` block refactoring.
- Rectified `govulncheck` execution paths within `security-audit.yml` to support multi-module workspaces.
- Corrected `gh run download` logic and pathing within `release-manager.yml` to reliably fetch release assets from parallel CI/CD jobs.
- Fixed `push` event triggers in GitHub Action workflows (`package.yml`, `security-audit.yml`, `compliance.yml`) to correctly execute on version tags.
