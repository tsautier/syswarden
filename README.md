# SysWarden

**An ultra-lightweight DevSecOps firewall orchestrator for Linux.** SysWarden (ver: v2.01) proactively drops 97% of malicious internet traffic by fusing [Data-Shield IPv4 blocklists](https://duggytuxy.github.io/), [IPdeny](https://www.ipdeny.com/ipblocks/), [Spamhaus ASN](https://www.spamhaus.org/drop/asndrop.json), [CINS Army](https://cinsscore.com/list/ci-badguys.txt), [Blocklist.de](https://www.blocklist.de/en/index.html), and dynamic [Fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban) jails with a near-zero memory footprint.

## Core Capabilities

* **Drop 97% of background noise** and scanner traffic instantly at the kernel level.
* **Cloak your SSH port** and administration panels behind an invisible WireGuard VPN.
* **Block hostile countries**, Cybercrime Hosters and rogue Autonomous System Numbers (ASN) automatically.
* **Protect 46+ services dynamically** (Docker, Nginx, Databases, CMS) via heavily optimized Fail2ban jails.
* **Monitor live threats** through a secure, self-hosted, and responsive Web Dashboard and CLI Dashboard.
* **Report attackers automatically** to the global AbuseIPDB network.

## Supported Environments

SysWarden is built to run flawlessly across modern Linux infrastructures:
* **Universal (systemd):** Debian 13+, Ubuntu 24.04+, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, CentOS Stream, Fedora.
* **Alpine Linux (OpenRC):** Highly optimized for lightweight containers and edge nodes.
* **Slackware (BSD-init):** Full native support with pure UNIX flat-file tailing.

## Management & Auditing Tools

SysWarden comes with dedicated built-in utilities to maintain and verify your infrastructure's security lifecycle:

* **`syswarden-manager.sh`**: The core administration utility. Use it to manually trigger threat-intel updates, manage your IP whitelists/blocklists, and check the firewall's operational status.
* **`syswarden-audit.sh`**: A comprehensive DevSecOps auditing tool designed to evaluate your server's security posture, analyze logs, and verify SysWarden's architectural integrity.

## The Fortress Dashboard

SysWarden includes a built-in, secure HTTPS UI to monitor your server's telemetry in real-time. It operates seamlessly without heavy database requirements.

* Track live Layer 3 (Kernel) & Layer 7 (Fail2ban) blocks.
* Analyze your top OSINT attackers.
* Review active jail allocations and memory usage.

*(Accessible via `https://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>:9999` after installation).*

## Quick Start

Deploying enterprise-grade security takes less than 10 minutes.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/duggytuxy/syswarden.git
cd syswarden
chmod +x *.sh
```

**2. Execute the installer matching your OS:**

*For Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, AlmaLinux & Rocky Linux:*

```bash
./install-syswarden.sh
```

*Alpine Linux:*

```bash
./install-syswarden-alpine.sh
```

*For Slackware (beta 4):*

```bash
./install-syswarden-slackware.sh
```

## Automated Deployments (CI/CD & Fleet Management)

For large-scale infrastructures and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) environments, SysWarden supports true zero-touch, unattended installations via the **`syswarden-auto.conf`** file.

* **Pre-define** your custom SSH ports, WireGuard subnets, API keys, and target blocklists without requiring any interactive prompts.
* **Seamlessly** integrate SysWarden into your CI/CD pipelines, Ansible playbooks, Terraform modules, or cloud-init bootstrap scripts.
* **Simply** edit the `syswarden-auto.conf` template with your environmental variables and execute the installer with the `syswarden-auto.conf` flag:

```bash
./install-syswarden*.sh syswarden-auto.conf
```

## Quick uninstall

Uninstall Syswarden properly while keeping your original settings.

```bash
./install-syswarden*.sh uninstall
```

## Target and support

> €3,000/year to fuel continuous DevSecOps improvements and integrations

Developing **SysWarden** and curating the zero-false-positive **Data-Shield IPv4 Blocklists** requires dedicated server infrastructure and non-stop threat monitoring. 

Reaching this annual goal guarantees my 100% independence, funding a continuous development cycle without corporate constraints. Your support directly pays for the servers and keeps these enterprise-grade cybersecurity tools free, updated, and accessible to everyone. 

Let's build a safer internet together!
