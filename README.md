# SysWarden

**SysWarden** is an enterprise-grade system hardening orchestrator and **HIPS (Host Intrusion Prevention System)** for Linux infrastructures.

It acts as a ruthless first line of defense. By fusing dynamic firewall orchestration (`nftables`/`iptables`), global Threat Intelligence ([Data-Shield IPv4](https://github.com/duggytuxy/Data-Shield_IPv4_Blocklist), GeoIP, ASN), a reactive HIPS (optimized Fail2ban), and SIEM alert routing, SysWarden filters out Internet "background noise" and neutralizes threats at the network (L2/L3/L4) and application (L7) levels. It perfectly complements modern EDR/XDR architectures by drastically reducing their analysis surface and the server's CPU load.

> **Deprecation Notice: Alpine Linux Support**
> Alpine Linux support is officially deprecated. SysWarden is evolving into a pure Enterprise HIPS standard. While Alpine remains a gold standard for ephemeral containers, the bare-metal servers and critical virtual machines that SysWarden is designed to protect rely predominantly on the `systemd` ecosystem (RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu). Unifying the architecture around `systemd` allows for much deeper security integrations and ensures reliability that meets production requirements.

> Designed for critical infrastructures, SysWarden automates server hardening to accelerate your **ISO 27001 and NIS2** compliance.

## Enterprise-Grade Features

**Core Network Defense (Hardware & Layer 2/3)**
* **L2/L3 Ingress Acceleration:** Injects Threat Intelligence directly into the `netdev` table under `nftables` (or `raw PREROUTING` under `iptables`). Malicious packets are destroyed right at the Network Interface Card (NIC), entirely bypassing kernel routing and the `conntrack` module to guarantee zero CPU impact during volumetric DDoS attacks.
* **Global Threat Intelligence:** Automatically blocks hostile countries (GeoIP), known cybercrime hosters, and rogue Autonomous System Numbers (ASN), instantly eliminating 97% of unwanted traffic.

**Application Security & Active Response (Layer 7)**
* **Dynamic L7 HIPS / WAF:** Protects 50+ vital services (Docker, Nginx, Databases, CMS) using deeply restructured and hardened Fail2ban "jails", ensuring a near-zero memory footprint and deadly accuracy (payload escaping, bypass prevention).
* **Standalone ModSecurity:** Seamlessly integrates [OWASP ModSecurity (v3.0.15)](https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity) via the `syswarden-waf.sh` component, providing deep HTTP traffic inspection.
* **Automated Retaliation:** Natively interfaces with the AbuseIPDB network to proactively report attackers and share telemetry.

**Zero-Trust & Compliance Architecture**
* **Service Cloaking:** Hides your SSH port and administrative interfaces behind a stealthy WireGuard VPN tunnel, deployed seamlessly.
* **Smart SIEM Routing:** Integrates with `rsyslog` to natively forward only high-value behavioral bans (Layer 7) to your SOC/SIEM (e.g., Wazuh). Intentionally filters out Layer 3 noise to prevent index saturation and control ingestion costs.
* **High Availability (HA) Cluster Sync:** Securely replicates Threat Intelligence states, whitelists, and configurations to passive nodes via an SSH-encrypted cron job.

**Observability & Lifecycle Management**
* **Real-Time Telemetry:** Monitor active threats, blocked IPs, and system health via a secure, self-hosted Web Dashboard (sterilized against XSS attacks) and a dedicated CLI interface.
* **"Scorched Earth" Surgical Rollback:** The uninstallation routine performs a deep cleanup. It eradicates custom `netdev` and `raw` tables, instantly restoring the OS network stack to its pristine original state without requiring a reboot.

## Hardware-Aware Zero-Trust Architecture

SysWarden doesn't just stack firewall rules; it orchestrates the Linux network stack to neutralize threats before they consume your resources:

1. **L2/L3 Ingress Drop (Priority -500):** OSINT blocklists, hostile ASNs, and GeoIP filtering are applied at the lowest level (NIC hook). Packets are destroyed before state tracking (`conntrack`), preventing table exhaustion and CPU overhead.
2. **Stateful Fast-Path (Priority 0):** Legitimate established connections and dynamic container traffic (e.g., `DOCKER-USER` chain) are prioritized. This stateful bypass guarantees zero latency for your production application traffic.
3. **Behavioral L7 Defense (HIPS):** The active defense layer analyzes application logs (via `systemd` journald) in real time. Any behavioral anomaly (brute-force, SQLi, LFI) triggers a surgical "AllPorts" ban that dynamically synchronizes the IP with the hardware drop tables.
4. **Zero-Trust "Catch-All":** The attack surface is hermetically sealed. Any incoming traffic not explicitly authorized by the administrator or the automatic service discovery engine is silently dropped, enforcing a strict Zero-Trust doctrine.

## Supported Environments

SysWarden is built to run natively across modern Linux infrastructures:
* **Universal (systemd):** Debian 13+, Ubuntu 24.04+, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, CentOS Stream, Fedora.

## The "Fortress" Dashboard (Web & CLI)

SysWarden provides dual-layer observability, ensuring total situational awareness without the bloat of a complex database (like ELK or InfluxDB).

**Secure Web Interface**
* **Live Threat Telemetry:** Track L7 behavioral bans in real time.
* **Attacker Profiling:** Visualize top OSINT offenders, blocked ASNs, and GeoIP interception stats.
* **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor the near-zero memory footprint of the underlying firewall engine.
* *(Self-hosted and securely accessible via `https://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>:9999` post-installation).*

**Orchestration & Interactive CLI**
* **Terminal Dashboard:** Manage your infrastructure directly from the shell via `syswarden-manager` (instant visibility into blocks, whitelists, and rule idempotency).
* **Structured Installation Logs:** The deployment process provides precise, color-coded visual feedback on OS hardening, SIEM integration, and the successful application of Zero-Trust policies.

## Installation Guide

SysWarden is distributed as a pre-compiled, self-contained shell script. All complex modules are bundled into a single deployment artifact.

Two installation methods are supported: a standard interactive mode, and an "Enterprise Zero-Trust" mode for environments requiring strict supply chain validation.

### 1. Quick Installation (Standard)

> Supported OS: *Debian 12+, Ubuntu 24.04+, RHEL 9+, Fedora 43+, CentOS Stream, AlmaLinux 10+ & Rocky Linux 9+*.

```bash
# Clone the repository and enter the directory (as root)
cd /usr/local/bin
git clone https://github.com/duggytuxy/syswarden.git
cd syswarden || exit

# Make the builder executable and compile the artifact
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh

# Navigate to the distribution folder and execute the installation
cd dist/ || exit
./install-syswarden.sh
```

### 2. Enterprise Installation (Zero-Trust / SLSA Level 3)

SysWarden releases are cryptographically signed using GitHub Artifact Attestations to guarantee supply chain integrity. For environments compliant with ISO 27001 or NIS2, it is imperative to verify the script's provenance before execution.

```bash
# 1. Download the release bundle
cd /usr/local/bin
wget https://github.com/duggytuxy/syswarden/releases/latest/download/syswarden-release.tar.gz

# 2. Verify the cryptographic attestation using the official GitHub CLI
gh attestation verify syswarden-release.tar.gz --owner duggytuxy

# 3. If the verification is successful (exit code 0), extract and run
tar -xzf syswarden-release.tar.gz
chmod +x install-syswarden.sh
./install-syswarden.sh
```

### 3. Automated / Headless Deployment (CI/CD)

SysWarden can be deployed without any human interaction using a configuration file, ideal for Ansible, Terraform, or Cloud-init pipelines.

```bash
# Copy the configuration template to the distribution directory
cp syswarden-auto.conf dist/

# Navigate to the distribution directory
cd dist/ || exit

# Secure the configuration file permissions
chmod 600 syswarden-auto.conf (modify if needed)

# Execute the silent installation with root privileges
./install-syswarden.sh syswarden-auto.conf
```

### 4.Quick uninstall (root)

Properly uninstalls SysWarden while preserving your original, legitimate network settings.

```bash
./install-syswarden.sh uninstall
```
